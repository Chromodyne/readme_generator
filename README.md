# readme_generator #

  **Note:** This repository contains my source code for a README generator using NodeJS as part of Challenge 9 of GA Tech's 2022 Coding Bootcamp.

  ## Description ##

  Making READMEs for software projects can be a hassle. With this small, but powerful, Node based tool you can easily generate a fully marked down README for your software projects in a matter of minutes! Simply answer a series of questions requesting information on your project name, description, license, etc. After completion, you will be furnished with a README in markdown format with the data you entered under the appropriate headings as well as a table of contents to make navigation easy!
